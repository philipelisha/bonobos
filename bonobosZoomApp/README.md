## Getting Started

The app was built using [https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app](create-react-app)

### Running `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will see the build errors and lint warnings in the console and browser.

### Approach

I chose to go with React/Redux. Since your site is also built on those technologies.
The build system is what comes with react-scripts. 

### Imrpovements

I would go through and name some things differently to make it easier to read. 
I would also add the feature on the zoom app on Bonobos.com where it first sets the Y value to 0 and then the X value a few miliseconds later.
