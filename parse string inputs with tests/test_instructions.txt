    If you use a build tool (e.g. Ant, nmake, maven, rake, etc.) to build your project, please include the build file as well.
    If you think the test or instructions could be improved, we welcome your feedback


INPUT FILE  INFORMATION

+Each file contains one person’s information per line.
+The properties of a person are delimited by the following:

    space (” “)
    comma (“,”)
    pipe (“|”)

You may assume that there are no delimiters in any of the properties themselves. Some properties (e.g. gender) are represented differently, depending on the delimiter. Dates are represented in American format (month, day, year).

The order of properties is different for each format. The pipe-delimited file lists each record as follows:
LastName | FirstName | MiddleInitial | Gender | FavoriteColor | DateOfBirth

The comma-delimited file looks like this:
LastName, FirstName, Gender, FavoriteColor, DateOfBirth

The space-delimited file looks like this:
  LastName FirstName MiddleInitial Gender DateOfBirth FavoriteColor


OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS

Create and display 3 different views of the recordset.

Output 1 – sorted by gender (females before males) then by last name ascending
Output 2 – sorted by birth date, ascending then by last name ascending
Output 3 – sorted by last name, descending
Ensure that fields are displayed in the following order: last name, first name, gender, date of birth, favorite color.
Display dates in the format M/D/YYYY.
